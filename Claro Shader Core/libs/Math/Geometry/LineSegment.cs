            /*  How do I find the distance from a point to a line segment?

                Let the point be C (Cx,Cy) and the line be AB (Ax,Ay) to (Bx,By).
                Let P be the point of perpendicular projection of C on AB.  The parameter
                r, which indicates P's position along AB, is computed by the dot product 
                of AC and AB divided by the square of the length of AB:
                
                (1)     AC dot AB
                    r = ---------  
                        ||AB||^2
                
                r has the following meaning:
                
                    r=0      P = A
                    r=1      P = B
                    r<0      P is on the backward extension of AB (and distance C-AB is distance C-A)
                    r>1      P is on the forward extension of AB (and distance C-AB is distance C-B)
                    0<r<1    P is interior to AB (and distance C-AB(segment) is distance C-AB(line))
                
                The length of the line segment AB is computed by:
                
                    L = sqrt( (Bx-Ax)^2 + (By-Ay)^2 )
                
                and the dot product of two 2D vectors, U dot V, is computed:
                
                    D = (Ux * Vx) + (Uy * Vy) 
                
                So (1) expands to:
                
                        (Cx-Ax)(Bx-Ax) + (Cy-Ay)(By-Ay)
                    r = -------------------------------
                             (Bx-Ax)^2 + (By-Ay)^2
            */

            // the above is modified here to compare the numerator and denominator, rather than doing the division
            DoublePoint abDelta = end - start;
            DoublePoint acDelta = point - start;

            double numerator   = acDelta.X * abDelta.X + acDelta.Y * abDelta.Y;
            double denomenator = abDelta.X * abDelta.X + abDelta.Y * abDelta.Y;

            ProjectionLocation result = ( numerator < 0 ) ? ProjectionLocation.RayA : ( numerator > denomenator ) ? ProjectionLocation.RayB : ProjectionLocation.SegmentAB;
